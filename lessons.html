    <h1>Guitar Lessons Designed Around You </h1>
  </div>
  <p class="lessons-text">
    Whilst growing up, I spent a lot of time taking guitar lessons from a handful of different tutors, from middle school all the way to university. While the majority of these lessons were to a great standard, there were a lot of things that I knew I would do differently as a tutor. Through the years I have witnessed firsthand the lessons of some of the world's best music educators, and the techniques that they use to create some of the world's top session musicians.
  </p>

  <p class="lessons-text">
    Today I use these experiences to craft fun, yet effective lessons for the needs of each individual student, in line with their personal goals and current ability. Week by week we'll work on the techniques and styles that are used by the greats, techniques that you'll use to create your own unique musical voice with the guitar.

    "I have been working with George for six months now and my playing has improved hugely with his help and direction. We use songs by artists that I like but always with a different technique that you can use in other songs, or if you write your own. The Zoom lessons have been great, no lateness! Added to this George sends videos to reinforce the lesson and I’ve really benefited from his help."<span class="lessons-container-author">Mike Pass</span>

    "We contacted George when my son wanted to learn to play the guitar, all I can say is George was the best decision we could have ever made. My son is thriving, he looks forward to every lesson. The lessons George delivers are outstanding and are always followed up by a WhatsApp message and video. George has not only given my son the confidence and love to carry out his newfound hobby. He has also given him the confidence to want to start learning to play the electric guitar as well which we have purchased for Christmas. Excellent value lessons. Thank you George."

    "George has been a great help for me improving my guitar. I came in as an intermediate player and so he's really helped me focus on my techniqueas well as an understanding of music theory to take me to the next level"
